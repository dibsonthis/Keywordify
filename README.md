# Keywordify

Keywordify is a tool that lets you create keywords and assign them to either text or Python functions.

You simply enter a keyword and choose if you want the keyword to act as a text replacement (really handy if you have a lot of information you copy/paste regularly) or a function (also handy if you want to execute Python functions from anywhere, even outside of the terminal).

So far this is only tested on Windows, please feel free to fork the repo and test it on your local machine.
